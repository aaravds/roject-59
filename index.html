        <p> My Favourite Hobby is reading books. It gives you knowlegde about almost everything and it also can be a source of entertainment. It can increase your knowledge and it is not harmful to you in any way. I read them for fun. It is better than looking at screens and reading them. They can hurt your eyes. You shouldn't read books in dim light. It can also hurt your eyes. If you look in screens too much or read in dim light a lot you have to wear glasses to read books. My favourites are Dog Man, Captain Underpants, Big Nate and The 13(multiples of 13) storey treehouse.</p>
